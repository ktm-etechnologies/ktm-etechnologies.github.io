## Open Source Software Projects

### nlcmd &ndash; A natural language phrase matching library for Android

![Android CI](https://github.com/ktm-etechnologies/nlcmd/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg)

Latest: <a href="./nlcmd.html#nlcmd-060">Nlcmd 0.6.0</a>

Android supports a number of voice control features, but enabling an individual
app for fine grained voice control is not straight forward. This library helps to
achieve that.

Features include
* Fast and efficient markov-chain based matching.
* Simple API for training markov chains from an string array of possible
  commands variations or loading models from JSON data.
* Support for generic terms such as locations or objects, such that they
  don't need to be enumerated in the training data.
* Support for creating <a href="https://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz Dot</a> 
  representations of models for visualization and debugging

The code is in proof-of-concept stage and feedback is welcome.
