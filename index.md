## Open Source Software Projects

### Phrase matching library for Android

Android supports a number of voice control features, but enabling an individual app for extensive voice control is not straight forward. This library helps to achieve that goal.

**Features include**

* Fast and efficient markov-chain based matching
* Simple API for training markov chains from an string array of possible commands variations
* Support for generic terms such as locations or objects, such that they don't need to be enumerated in the training data

Code is in proof-of-concept stage and feedback is welcome. The git repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ktm-technologies/markov-phrase-matching-android">https://github.com/ktm-technologies/markov-phrase-matching-android</a>.
