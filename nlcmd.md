## Release 0.6.0

KTM Technologies nlcmd is a natural language phrase matching library for Android. 
Together with Android's built-in speech-to-text functionality it can be used to implement
fine-grained voice control for Android apps.

and we are happy to receive feedback and suggestions for desired improvements and functionality.

* An easy to use high-level API for training and matching phrases with just a handful lines of code.

* Storing and loading Markov models from and to JSON data.
* Support for generic terms such as locations or objects, such that they
  don't need to be enumerated in the training data.
